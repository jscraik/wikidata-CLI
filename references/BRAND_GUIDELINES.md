# brAInwav Brand Styling

## Overview

Use this reference to apply BrAInwav's brand identity consistently across software repositories and supporting artifacts. This is intended to support clarity, provenance, and readability in developer workflows (not marketing).
Keep it lightweight and practical. Favor clarity over decoration.
When in doubt, keep the footer small. Avoid heavy styling.
This guidance is for documentation only. It is not for product UI.

## Summary
Use the footer only in root READMEs.
Keep the mark small.
Avoid watermarks.
Use clean, simple text.

## Quick rules
Use the signature only in root READMEs.
Keep marks small and clear.
Do not use watermarks.
Avoid heavy visual effects.
Prefer WebP assets.
Use PNG only when needed.
Keep alt text short.

**Keywords**: branding, corporate identity, visual identity, documentation signature, styling, brand colors, typography, brAInwav, visual formatting, visual design, provenance

## Documentation Signature (Recommended)

BrAInwav uses a **documentation signature**, not a watermark. The signature is a small footer marker placed in root-level README files (and optionally key reference docs) to indicate stewardship without adding visual noise.
Use it only at the end of the README. Keep it simple.

### Approved Text (Primary)

brAInwav
*from demo to duty*

### Optional Text (Only when a descriptor is required)

brAInwav - software engineering
*from demo to duty*

### Rules

- The tagline is always secondary (smaller / lighter emphasis than the name).
- Do not reword the tagline.
- Do not place signatures inside technical sections or between headings.
- Do not use watermarks in READMEs or technical docs.

### README Footer Snippet (WebP + Text)

```md
---

<img
  src="./brand/brand-mark.webp"
  srcset="./brand/brand-mark.webp 1x, ./brand/brand-mark@2x.webp 2x"
  alt="brAInwav"
  height="28"
  align="left"
/>

<br clear="left" />

**brAInwav**  
_from demo to duty_
```

### ASCII Fallback (Non-Graphical Environments)

Use when images are unavailable (terminal/plain text):

```text
brAInwav
from demo to duty
```

Do not mix ASCII and image marks in the same document.

## Brand Guidelines

### Colors

**Main Colors:**

- Dark: `#141413` - Primary text and dark backgrounds.
- Light: `#faf9f5` - Light backgrounds and text on dark.
- Mid Gray: `#b0aea5` - Secondary elements.
- Light Gray: `#e8e6dc` - Subtle backgrounds.

**Accent Colors:**

- Orange: `#d97757` - Primary accent.
- Blue: `#6a9bcc` - Secondary accent.
- Green: `#788c5d` - Tertiary accent.

**Usage Rules**

- Accent colors are decorative; do not rely on accent color alone to convey meaning.
- Maintain readable contrast in light and dark contexts.

### Typography

- **Headings**: Poppins (fallback: Arial).
- **Body Text**: Lora (fallback: Georgia).
- **Note**: Fonts should be pre-installed in your environment for best results.

## Features

### Smart Font Application

- Applies Poppins font to headings (24pt and larger).
- Applies Lora font to body text.
- Automatically falls back to Arial/Georgia if custom fonts unavailable.
- Preserves readability across all systems.

### Text Styling

- Headings (24pt+): Poppins font.
- Body text: Lora font.
- Smart color selection based on background.
- Preserves text hierarchy and formatting.

### Shape and Accent Colors

- Non-text shapes use accent colors.
- Cycles through orange, blue, and green accents.
- Maintains visual interest while staying on-brand.

## Visual Mark (WebP)

If you include a mark, keep it minimal and documentation-safe.
Use small sizes. Avoid decorative effects.

### Asset Requirements

- Format: WebP (primary), PNG (optional fallback).
- Background: may be transparent or badge-style (if badge-style, ensure it stays legible on both light and dark README themes).
- No glow/blur/animation.
- Must be legible at 24-32px height.
- Provide a 2x retina version.

### Placement

- Root README files only (bottom-left footer).
- Not used as a watermark.

### Accessibility

- Always include `alt` text.
- No color-only meaning.

## Technical Details

### Font Management

- Uses system-installed Poppins and Lora fonts when available.
- Provides automatic fallback to Arial (headings) and Georgia (body).
- No font installation required - works with existing system fonts.
- For best results, pre-install Poppins and Lora fonts in your environment.

### Color Application

- Uses RGB color values for precise brand matching.
- Applied via python-pptx's RGBColor class.
- Maintains color fidelity across different systems.

## Enforcement (Make docs consistent)

To keep documentation consistent across repos, enforce the brand rules in process and automation:

- **Templates**: Start new docs from the standard templates in `assets/` (README, doc, and agents templates). Update templates when guidelines change.
- **Review checklist**: Require the Doc QA checklist to pass in doc PR reviews.
- **CI linting**: Run markdownlint/vale (if present) plus a custom check that verifies:
  - Root `README.md` contains the documentation signature snippet.
  - `/brand/` assets exist (`brand-mark.webp`, `brand-mark@2x.webp`, optional PNGs).
  - No watermark usage in README or technical docs.
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Optionally block commits that remove or alter the signature.

## Recommended Repo Layout

- `brand/brand-mark.webp`.
- `brand/brand-mark@2x.webp`.
- `brand/brand-mark.png` (optional fallback).
- `brand/brand-mark@2x.png` (optional fallback).
- `brand/README.md` (usage rules + do/don't).

Keep asset names exact. Do not rename them.

## Skill Asset Location

The official mark assets are stored in this skill and can be copied into a repo's `brand/` directory:

- `assets/brand/brand-mark.webp`
- `assets/brand/brand-mark@2x.webp`
- `assets/brand/brand-mark.png`
- `assets/brand/brand-mark@2x.png`
