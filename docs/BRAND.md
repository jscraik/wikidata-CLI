## Document requirements
- Audience: contributors styling documentation.
- Scope: colors, typography, and basic Markdown presentation guidance.
- Non-scope: marketing assets, product UI, or brand strategy work.
- Owner: repository maintainers.
- Review cadence: every release or at least quarterly.
- Required approvals: maintainers for public changes.

## Brand palette
Primary colors:
- Dark: `#141413`.
- Light: `#faf9f5`.
- Mid Gray: `#b0aea5`.
- Light Gray: `#e8e6dc`.
Use these as the base. Keep contrast readable.

Accent colors:
- Orange: `#d97757`.
- Blue: `#6a9bcc`.
- Green: `#788c5d`.

## Typography
- Headings: Poppins (fallback Arial).
- Body: Lora (fallback Georgia).
Use system fallbacks when fonts are missing.

## Usage guidelines
Use short headings and simple phrasing. This keeps the docs easy to scan.

- Use headings to create structure and call attention to key sections.
- Use bold text for key actions only.
- Keep code blocks minimal and consistent.

## Troubleshooting
### Symptom: fonts do not render as expected
Cause: Poppins and Lora are not installed.
Fix: install fonts locally or rely on fallbacks.
If you cannot install fonts, use the fallbacks.

## Reference
- Brand colors and typography are defined in `references/BRAND_GUIDELINES.md`.
